# ChatGPT-4-0-Slap-Battles-script
i've been thinking about using chatgpt, and it's coding capabilities, and i made it make me this script. very simple, prolly woulda taken me about an hour to make, but i wanted to test how good the scripts it makes are.
this one is pretty good, the slapDistance is broken, you need to change the value at the top, rather than the slider. other than that, its perfect. i might add some more gloves to support the Slap Aura, because it only supports Slapple as of 7/28/24.
it's interesting because i fed it some of my code, and it mimicked the way i wrote it, very cool, and useful. since i write in a simple way that's easy for me to read, it's helpful for it to do that. i'm confident i can read this code, and tell you what everything does with atleast 99% confidence. i really dont feel comfortable writing code with chatgpt, without me understanding it. so before i went straight to ChatGPT to write my code, i wanted to get used to ACTUALLY writing code, so its not something i have to sweep under the rug later on LOL.
I might tell ChatGPT to add an Anti-Fall that teleports me to the center of Island1 when i go past certain parameters, so i never die, basically keeping people from saying "HAHA LOSER U SUCK HAKCS AND STILL LOST LLLL"
after that, i would once again, add more gloves. the way slapping works, is every glove has a vertain Remote that fires. so the first glove has the remote called "b" and Slapple's is called SlappleHit.
so it's a little random, the way they set it up. so i kinda need to spend an hour just taking note of 200 gloves, and finding each remote. that sucks. so really this script only supports the slapple and the basic glove.
